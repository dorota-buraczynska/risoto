>TEMPLATE EXERCISE

Yet another template exercise. This time from [webflow templates](https://webflow.com/templates).  
In this project I used BEM methodology. I think that this helped me to achieve easier to write and maintain stylesheets.  

## You can find here:
1. Mobile first RWD approach.
2. Own slider script with video.
3. BEM methodology.
4. Interactive restaurant menu.
5. Own pop-up gallery with animation.
6. Parallax scroll effect.
7. Contact form.
